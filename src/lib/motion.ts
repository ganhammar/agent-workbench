/**
 * How panes and rows come and go.
 *
 * What these promise the grid: no column ever animates. A pane on its way out
 * leaves the flow in the same frame it is asked to go, at the box it had, so
 * the panes that stay take their new widths at once and the agent's terminal
 * is told its size once rather than on every frame of a slide. A pane on its
 * way in moves while in flow, since the column it needs is already there. A
 * row fades where it stands, and the rows below it move only once it has gone.
 *
 * A pane going is therefore two things: the box it is held at, which is set
 * before the columns change, and the transition, which is paint from there
 * on.
 *
 * Nothing moves while the system asks for reduced motion: every transition
 * here is instant then, and what it was going to animate is simply the way it
 * ends up.
